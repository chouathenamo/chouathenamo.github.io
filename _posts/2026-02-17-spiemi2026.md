## Overview

Anatomical landmark detection in pelvic fluoroscopy is critical for surgical planning in procedures like Total Hip Arthroplasty, where accurate localization guides component placement and biomechanical alignment. Existing U-Net-based methods assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view, which breaks down under realistic intraoperative conditions where patient or imaging unit orientation varies. We propose a training framework that integrates 2D/3D landmark-based registration into the U-Net training loop via a **Pose Estimation Loss (PEL)**, penalizing geometric error between predicted 2D coordinates and ground truth 3D projections rather than relying solely on pixel-wise segmentation loss.

## Key Contributions

- Proposed integrating 2D/3D registration as a Pose Estimation Loss into U-Net landmark detection training, directly penalizing geometric localization error.
- Demonstrated that **sequential fine-tuning** with PEL outperforms joint optimization, achieving 8.8% RMSE improvement on the external test set over the baseline.
- Showed that training with PEL alone diverges, and composite loss degrades performance (~2.4× error increase), establishing that pre-trained initialization is necessary for geometric loss to provide meaningful gradients.
